A Python implementation of the ANT+ Protocol  

The goal of this project is to provide a clean, Python-only implementation of the [ANT+ Protocol](https://www.thisisant.com). Usage of the library should require little to no knowledge of the ANT+ Protocol internals. It should be easy to use, easy to read, and have proper error handling.

This project was born when I decided to completely rewrite the [python-ant library](https://github.com/mvillalba/python-ant) from scratch, after not finding a fork that suited my needs. There were so many different forks of the original project, each with their own patches, but not a properly useable one. Because of this, there may be parts of the code which look similar to the python-ant library, as I have their code as a reference.
